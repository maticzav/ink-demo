# Ink Demo

This is a demo of Ink for my talk at Algoia, Paris.

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

## 1. Example (Hello World)

This example shows basic usage of Ink with Stateless components.

* mind the most top line where we import pragma to use Ink and render at the bottom!

```jsx
import { h, render } from 'ink'

// Render
render(h(Basic))
```

## 2. Example (Counter)

* This example illustrates how to use Ink Component to handle state changes and react to keyboard input.

```jsx
```

## 3. Example (TODO List)

* This example shows the basic usage of Community written libraries which make Ink awesome!

```jsx
```
